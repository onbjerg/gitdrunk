# What the fuck is gitdrunk?
gitdrunk is a git game designed to make you a better developer and alcoholic by coding drunk. Hell, it might even make you a better person.

The game makes those lonely weekend nights spent programming and sipping your shitty, domestic beer less suicidal.

# How do I play?
It's easy. All the rules are embedded in the program. Fun, right? No.

In order to play, just install the game and use ``gitd`` instead of ``git``.

# Well, what are you waiting for?
Install it using ``npm install -g gitdrunk``. You know you want to.

# Serious business
Heavily inspired by [gitdrunk.com](http://gitdrunk.com). This just forces me to remember the rules.

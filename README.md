gitdrunk is a git game designed to make you a better developer and alcoholic by coding drunk. Hell, it might even make you a better person.

The game makes those lonely weekend nights spent programming and sipping your domestic beer less suicidal.

## How do I play?
It's easy. All the rules are embedded in the program.

In order to play, just install the game and use ``gitd`` instead of ``git``. All standard git commands work!

## Well, what are you waiting for?
Install it using ``npm install -g gitdrunk``. You know you want to.
